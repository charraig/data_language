# Motivation

I earned my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering and then went
on to earn a master's in applied mathematics and statistics, working as a data
analyst / scientist. Throughout that process, I noticed that the field seemed
to lack a consistent and precise vocabulary. This project was intended to 
clarify and define that basic data science vocabulary. It is by no means
comprehensive but tries to cover the major points of ambiguity and common
terminology used in the field.

# Next Steps

* Add "target" as a synonym for output variable
* Disambiguate "unique"
* Add "validation" and "scoring"
* Add "random" and "variable" slides in the Random Variable section
